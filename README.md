# code-quiz
Building a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 


Acceptable Criteria DESCRIPTION:

+a timer starts and the user is presented with a question when they click the start button

+the user is presented with another question when they answer a question

+time is subtracted from the clock when the user answers a question incorrectly

+the game is over when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0

+the user can save their initials and their score when the game is over


NOTES/CHALLENGES:

+(HTML/CSS/JS) - only one question should be displayed at a time, this was achieved by making each question its own div/id in HTML and then creating a "display: none" for each question in CSS and "display: block" for each click event in JS

+(HTML/CSS) - each answer option needs to be a button

+(JS) - when an answer is clicked, "correct" or "incorrect" needs to be displayed then move to the next question

+(JS) - need text box for users to enter their initials

+(JS) - "clear highscores" button needs to clear the page

+(JS) - increasing/decreasing score needs to be rendered

+(JS) - countdown timer needs to be rendered
